# OpenTact: Open Source Headset
The goal of this project is to provide the design files, electronics, software, and algorithms to allow you to build your own electronic communications headset.  Multiple headset designs are available here.  We hope that this work will help you get to your goal faster, whether it be research and development or simply fun audio hacking!
## Headset Designs
Three headset designs are included.  As shown below, there is the "Ear" headset, the "Low-Profile" (LoPro) headset, and the "Full-Profile" (FullPro) headset.
